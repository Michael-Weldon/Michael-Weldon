- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael. New to working through github or in any form of code or web dev to be honest.
- Im looking to change industries and move from hospitality to some sort of office possition, hopefully soemthing remote or hybrid.
- Plans are to use this for creating my own personal site and online portfolio for peronal use and for use in seeking employment.
- Planning for the best but not getting my hopes up.
- 👀 I’m interested in. Thats a loaded question in any case, usually I like to relax and watch TV, movies, anime and generally waisting time, its fun. But at the same time I do like to go out as well. Lately been trying new things such as VR games venues etc and trying to go out to little events like GoKart racing, Ice skating etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, Well to be fair, everything. Starting to learn all about code and data analitics but not getting to cought up in it. Trying to have a little more fun in my spair time of late instead of stressing out.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing just now, any guidens people can provide is great but Im not at a stage where I have an real project going or the knowledge to help on others but I hope to get there in the near future.
- 📫 How to reach me. If you need to you can email, michael.a.weldon@hotmail.com
